For the final project, we were required to select our own dataset and build an autoregressive Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) fully in JAX, followed by providing examples of the sequences generated by the model.<br>
You can find further details of the individual points to cover in the Final project notebook attached to this repository (***`NNDS_2024_Final_Homework.ipynb`***).
